# == Ongoing Research Projects
# - *Physical Visualization Design (PVD)*
# -- PVD is a system that visualization designers can use to co-design the interface and system architecture of scalable and expressive visualizations
# 
# - *GitSync: Distributed Git over Named Data Networking (NDN)*
# -- Migrated Git push and fetch to run over NDN (instead of HTTPS/SSH)
# -- Designed access control policies and consistency mechanisms, removing the need for a central server\n
