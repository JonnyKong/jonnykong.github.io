== Ongoing Research Projects
- *Physical Visualization Design (PVD)*
-- PVD is a system that visualization designers can use to co-design the interface and system architecture of scalable and expressive visualizations
-- Submitted to SIGMOD 2020 Demonstration track

- *GitSync: Distributed Git over Named Data Networking (NDN)*
-- Migrated Git push and fetch to run over NDN (instead of HTTPS/SSH)
-- Designed access control policies and consistency mechanisms, removing the need for a central server
